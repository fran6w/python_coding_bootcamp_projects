    "#### Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of this project is to download the dataset, and to load and transform the `DataFrame` so that **it has exactly the same characteristics** than the full US `DataFrame` that we have studied in the Python coding bootcamp.\n",
    "\n",
    "To read properly the file, you should use the pandas `read_csv()` function with the appropriate arguments, please refer to the pandas documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `DataFrame` has the appropriate shape: N rows x 4 columns\n",
    "\n",
    "- The column names are properly set\n",
    "\n",
    "- Columns are properly ordered: `year`, `name`, `gender` and `births`\n",
    "\n",
    "- The data type, or `dtype`, of each column is properly set\n",
    "\n",
    "- The values of the `gender` column are properly set: `'F'` for female and `'M'` for male\n",
    "\n",
    "- Names with a single character are discarded\n",
    "\n",
    "- The case of all names is properly modified: all initials are upper case and other letters lower case\n",
    "\n",
    "- Rows with unusable values are discarded\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data are properly sorted: `year`, `gender`, `births` (descending) and `name`\n",
    "\n",
    "- The index of the `DataFrame` is properly set: 0 to N-1. For this last requirement you should use the `reset_index()` method of `DataFrame`  with the appropriate arguments, please refer to the pandas documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Nota bene*: The French dataset discarded names with fewer than 3 occurrences instead of 5 for the US one. We let the limit of 3 since the French dataset is smaller than the US one. Therefore, there is no requirements for this point."
